# EMNIST-Mathematical-Model using deep learning 

## 📌 Project Description
The **EMNIST Mathematical Model** is a deep learning–based mini project that focuses on
**handwritten English alphabet recognition (A–Z)** using the **EMNIST dataset**.
The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten characters
with high accuracy.

This project demonstrates how mathematical models and deep learning techniques can be
applied to **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and document digitization.
